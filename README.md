# Loan Approval Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning models to automate the loan approval process, optimizing decision-making in financial institutions. The system leverages data preprocessing, feature engineering, and diverse classifiers to predict loan approval outcomes efficiently.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature encoding, scaling, and dataset balancing.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and MLP Classifier.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Comprehensive comparison of models using metrics like accuracy, F1 score, recall, and ROC AUC.

## Dataset
The dataset contains applicant demographics, financial history, and loan-specific attributes, used to train and evaluate the models. It is located in the repository as `loan-train.csv`.

## Installation and Usage
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: Install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
